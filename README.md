amalgamemnon's PF2e AutoCover

Overview

amalgamemnon's PF2e AutoCover is a Foundry VTT module designed to automate cover calculations in Pathfinder 2e, leveraging the Levels-AutoCover module. This module ensures that cover effects are applied dynamically based on visibility, obstacles, and special conditions such as the "Take Cover" action.

Features

âœ… Automatically applies cover effects based on Levels-AutoCover's detection.âœ… Supports multiple targeted tokens, applying effects individually.âœ… Removes cover effects when a token is untargeted.âœ… Upgrades Standard Cover to Greater Cover when the target has the "Has Taken Cover" effect.âœ… Detects "No Cover - Obstructed" cases and applies Lesser Cover when necessary.âœ… Automatically configures Levels-AutoCover settings on startup, ensuring correct functionality.âœ… Detailed logging for debugging to track cover changes.

Installation

To install the module:

Download the module from the GitHub Repository or Foundry package manager.

Place it in your Foundry VTT Data/modules/ folder.

Enable it in Foundry VTT > Game Settings > Manage Modules.

Ensure Levels-AutoCover is installed and enabled.

How It Works

This module works by:

Detecting cover using Levels-AutoCover when a token is targeted.

Applying the correct cover effect based on the target's visibility:

Greater Cover (â‰¤ 25% visibility)

Standard Cover (â‰¤ 50% visibility)

Lesser Cover (â‰¤ 75% visibility)

Upgrading Standard Cover to Greater Cover if the target has "Has Taken Cover."

Applying Lesser Cover if Levels-AutoCover detects "No Cover - Obstructed."

Removing cover effects when a token is untargeted.

Automatically configuring Levels-AutoCover settings using game.settings.set() on module load.
